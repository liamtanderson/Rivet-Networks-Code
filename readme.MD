This is a collection of four automated tests with robot framework runner files that test various aspects of Killer Control Software. Bandwidth_Maximum_Cap_Test.py sees if the bandwidth cap feature of the software works using selenium and an online network test. Iperf_Test.py tests to see if the bandwidth cap works using iperf rather than an online test. DSCP_Verification.py checks if the software's packet priority system is working correctly. Automated_Vmware_operations.py can perform a series of system management functions on Rivet's vms. These code snippets were scaled to Rivet's vm farm and deployed via a Jenkins server.
